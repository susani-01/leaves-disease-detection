# Plant Leaf Disease Detection using Image Processing

This repository contains code for an image processing approach to detect and segment healthy and diseased plant leaves.  The method uses grayscale conversion and thresholding for efficient and cost-effective disease detection.

## Overview

The process includes three stages:

1. **Preprocessing:** Grayscale conversion is used to enhance images and simplify analysis.
2. **Segmentation:** Thresholding isolates the leaf from the background.
3. **Post-processing:** Edge detection and contour analysis refine segmented images.

## Results

Evaluated on 100 leaf images, the method achieved 66.66% accuracy, detecting 68% of infected and 75% of healthy leaves.

## Limitations

* Limited dataset diversity.
* Reliance on grayscale processing.

## Future Work

* Incorporate color information.
* Apply machine learning algorithms.
* Use larger, more diverse datasets.

## Getting Started

## Getting Started

This project uses Python 3.  Install the required libraries:numpy,matplotlib.
